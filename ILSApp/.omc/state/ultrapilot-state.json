And pretty much now that you have the actual backend running, you can first reorient yourself to the entire plan, explore, get context, and then now start autonomously working until every single validation gate. Remember to keep in mind the actual inspection process and you can never circumnavigate a gate. You should always just be sequentially thinking, never trying and figuring it out and debugging. After you read every single line of this file, which is a very large file, I want you to sequentially think we're 10 to 15 thoughts. Then you may begin execution with parallel sub-agents once you've oriented where you are and how you orchestrate and you have thought through how the pattern and moving forward is going to work and how you'll basically be the validation and architect validation agent too.",
