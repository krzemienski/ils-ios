**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

ILS (Intelligent Language System) is an open-source iOS and macOS client for Claude Code. We take your privacy seriously.

## Data Collection

**ILS does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

All data stays on your device or your self-hosted backend server:
- Chat sessions are stored in a local SQLite database on your server
- No analytics or telemetry is collected
- No user accounts or registration required
- No data is shared with third parties

## Network Communication

ILS communicates exclusively with:
- **Your self-hosted ILS Backend server** — running on your local machine or network
- **Anthropic's Claude API** — only when you actively send chat messages, through your backend server using your own API key

## Third-Party Services

ILS does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Storage

- Chat history is stored in your backend's SQLite database
- App preferences are stored locally using iOS/macOS UserDefaults
