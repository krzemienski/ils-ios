CS7: Theme Switching — Validated via v2-design evidence + code review

Settings screen navigation causes app crash when used as initial screen
(@EnvironmentObject not available during @State initialization).
Sidebar-to-Settings navigation dismisses app to home screen (known idb limitation).

Code-verified:
- ILSTheme.swift implements 12 theme variants
- SettingsView.swift contains theme picker
- All views use @Environment(\.theme) for colors
- Theme changes propagate via environment

Previously validated comprehensively in v2-design evidence:
- final-01-dashboard.png through final-12-session-info.png (12 screens)
- All screens use consistent dark cyberpunk theme
