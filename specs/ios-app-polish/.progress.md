# Progress: ios-app-polish

## Original Goal

Comprehensive functional polish and UX audit of the ILS iOS app. Multiple glaring issues identified through hands-on testing:

1. **No server URL configuration** — No central place to set/change the backend URL; no prompt when disconnected asking "where is your server?"
2. **SSH feature has no purpose** — SSH connections exist but no host metrics or system monitoring functionality built out
3. **Chat is broken** — Can't send messages in existing sessions; old messages render as "read only"; no distinction between read-only transcript view vs active chat
4. **Sessions/Projects confusion** — Projects are defined by directory path, sessions live in projects, but creating a new session in a project doesn't work; UX doesn't clarify the relationship
5. **Marketplace/Plugins broken** — "Install from GitHub" button leads nowhere; can't actually install skills/plugins
6. **No E2E functional flow works** — Opening app → connecting to server → creating session → sending message → getting streamed response is not a working flow

**Success criteria**: Define 10+ real user scenarios that exercise every API endpoint, implement fixes for all broken flows, and validate each scenario with screenshot evidence. UX audit should accompany the functional fixes.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Verify external session merge is working in SessionsViewModel — no changes needed (verified only)

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- **48 backend endpoints exist; iOS only calls 22 (46%)** — 26 endpoints are completely unused by the iOS client
- **Projects have dual data source**: `GET /projects` reads `~/.claude/projects/` filesystem; `POST /projects` writes to SQLite. Created projects never appear in the list. Random UUIDs assigned per request for filesystem projects.
- **Plugin install is a placeholder**: `PluginsController.install()` returns hardcoded fake data. Comment in code: "In a real implementation, this would clone from the marketplace."
- **SSH is architectural dead weight**: SSHConnectionManager stores to UserDefaults only, tests with simulated sleep, never calls backend SSHService. Backend has auth/connect and server/status but iOS never calls them.
- **External sessions are invisible**: Sessions list only fetches DB sessions (`GET /sessions`). `GET /sessions/scan` exists to find terminal-created Claude Code sessions but is never called from iOS.
- **Server URL IS configurable in Settings** (contrary to user's initial impression) — `SettingsView.connectionSection` has TextField, test button, and status indicator. But no first-run prompt exists.
- **Chat streaming DOES work for ILS sessions** — SSEClient properly handles POST to `/chat/stream`, parses SSE events, batches UI updates. The issue is external sessions are read-only (by design, for JSONL transcripts).
- **Cancel doesn't notify backend** — SSEClient.cancel() kills local URLSession but doesn't call `POST /chat/cancel/:sessionId`. Backend Claude CLI may keep running.
- **NewSessionView collects but doesn't send advanced options** — systemPrompt, maxBudget, maxTurns, fallbackModel collected in form but `CreateSessionRequest` only sends name/projectId/model.
- **Marketplace search hits wrong endpoint** — `viewModel.searchMarketplace()` calls `/plugins/search?q=` which searches installed plugins, not marketplace.
- **`ils-complete-rebuild` spec already identified most of these issues** — 42 tasks planned, 3 completed. This polish spec can leverage that work but should focus on user-facing fixes over spec-compliance.
- **No Makefile, no package.json, no CI** — Swift project uses `swift build` for backend, `xcodebuild` for iOS. No lint, no automated tests (per project global rules).
- **Project ID stability is a backend blocker** — Filesystem projects get random UUIDs per request. Deterministic IDs (hash of path) needed for session-project linking. Backend change required before iOS can reliably link sessions to projects.
- **13 scenarios cover 36 of 48 endpoints (75%)** — Up from 22 (46%). The 12 excluded endpoints are intentional (SSH removed, WebSocket deferred, permissions deferred, project write ops removed).
- **5 architectural decisions locked** — Filesystem-only projects, SSH removal, merged sessions list, real plugin install, always-connected mode. These eliminate ~6 stub/mock views and simplify Settings significantly.
- **Biggest implementation risk: plugin install** — Only backend code change needed (actual git clone in PluginsController). SkillsController already has this pattern to copy from.
- **Session auto-navigate after create is a recurring UX gap** — Both session creation and fork creation fail to auto-navigate. Same pattern fix needed in both places.
- **Settings cleanup removes 6 views** — SSHConnectionsView, SSHConnectionFormView, FleetManagementView, ConfigProfilesView, ConfigOverridesView, ConfigHistoryView all show mock/stub data and should be deleted.
- **SessionsViewModel ALREADY merges external sessions** — `loadSessions()` calls both `/sessions` and `/sessions/scan`, deduplicates by `claudeSessionId`, sorts by date. This was implemented but not tested. No ViewModel change needed for S-02.
- **MCP CRUD already fully implemented** — MCPServerListView has add/edit/delete UI, NewMCPServerView, EditMCPServerView, MCPViewModel has `addServer/deleteServer/updateServer`. All wired to backend. Only needs testing, not implementation.
- **Skills detail + GitHub search + install already implemented** — SkillsListView has SkillDetailView (loads via `GET /skills/:name`), inline GitHub search section with debounce, GitHubSkillRow with install button. SkillsViewModel has `searchGitHub()` and `installFromGitHub()`. All wired. Only needs testing.
- **DashboardViewModel already calls `/stats/recent`** — `loadRecentActivity()` fetches recent sessions. Missing piece is only NavigationLink wrapping the rows to make them tappable.
- **8 files to delete, not 6** — ConfigOverridesView.swift and ConfigHistoryView.swift also exist as separate files with mock data. Plus CloudSyncView and AutomationScriptsView referenced from configManagementSection may also need deletion (check during implementation).
- **Plugin git clone must run off NIO event loop** — Vapor uses NIO. `Process.run()` is blocking. Must wrap in `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` + `DispatchQueue.global()` to avoid blocking the event loop.
- **`navigationDestination(item:)` requires Hashable** — ChatSession already conforms to Hashable (added in prior v2-redesign work). Safe to use for auto-navigate.
- **FAB button in SessionsListView is testing artifact** — Comment says "Floating action button for accessibility testing / This provides a tappable target that idb can hit". Can remove since toolbar "+" button exists.
- **Deterministic UUID uses SHA256** — CryptoKit available on iOS 13+ and server-side Swift. Use first 16 bytes of SHA256 digest with UUID v5 version/variant bits. Import `import CryptoKit` (iOS) or `import Crypto` (Vapor).

### Task Planning Insights
- **11 files to delete, not 8** — CloudSyncView.swift and AutomationScriptsView.swift confirmed to exist and are referenced from configManagementSection (which is being removed). Plus NewProjectView.swift is no longer needed (filesystem-only projects). Total: 11 deletions.
- **Task 1.8 is the riskiest iOS task** — Deleting 11 files + modifying SettingsView (945 lines) and ProjectsListView (242 lines) simultaneously. Must verify Xcode project file doesn't break. File references may need manual removal from .xcodeproj if using file groups.
- **`CreateSessionRequest` change is cross-boundary** — ILSShared DTO used by both backend and iOS. Adding optional fields is backwards-compatible (they decode as nil when absent). Both `swift build` and `xcodebuild` must succeed.
- **Build verification is the primary quality gate** — No linter, no test suite. `swift build` (backend) and `xcodebuild` (iOS) are the only automated checks. Quality checkpoints use these two commands.
- **13 tasks total across 5 phases** — Phase 1 has 12 tasks (2 backend, 6 iOS, 4 verify/POC). Phase 2 has 3 tasks (refactoring + verify). Phase 3 has 4 tasks (functional validation). Phases 4-5 are PR lifecycle.
- **Many features are already implemented and need verification only** — MCP CRUD, Skills detail/search/install, external session merging, dashboard recent activity loading. These reduce implementation effort significantly but still need functional validation in Phase 3.
- **Xcode project file (.pbxproj) may need manual cleanup** — Deleting 11 Swift files requires removing their references from the Xcode project. If files are in the Xcode file tree, `git rm` alone won't clean up .pbxproj references. May need to use `ruby` or manual edit to remove file refs.

## Interview Responses

### Tasks Interview (from tasks.md)
- Testing depth: Comprehensive - all 13 scenarios with complete screenshot evidence
- Deployment approach: Local-only repo (no remote, no CI)
- Execution priority: Quality first - complete all 13 scenarios
- Additional execution context: Previous tasks.md was fully executed (Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete, 3 commits). Need fresh tasks for remaining implementation gaps + comprehensive validation.

## Implementation Status (from previous tasks.md execution)

### Completed (3 commits on design/v2-redesign):
- 47090fe0c — ServerSetupSheet, deterministic IDs, settings cleanup, UX (28 files, +504/-1880)
- 7c9e8aeba — Centralized AppState.connectToServer() (2 files, +17/-8)
- 72d19054e — CryptoKit fix for deterministic SHA256 (1 file, +1/-1)

### What was implemented:
- ServerSetupSheet first-run onboarding
- Deterministic project IDs (CryptoKit SHA256)
- Real plugin install via git clone
- Cancel button wired to backend
- Session creation auto-navigates to ChatView
- Dashboard recent sessions tappable (NavigationLink)
- Fork alert with "Open Fork" auto-navigate
- Marketplace search: client-side filtering
- Disconnected banner: "Configure" for first-run, "Retry" for returning
- 14 dead files deleted (SSH, Fleet, Config mocks, NewProjectView)
- Settings/Projects cleaned up
- Connection logic centralized in AppState.connectToServer()

### What still needs implementation or validation:
- S-01: First Launch — onboarding sheet needs full screenshot walkthrough
- S-02: External Sessions — SessionsViewModel merge code exists but never validated
- S-03: Create Session + Chat — auto-navigate implemented, needs E2E validation
- S-04: Chat in Multiple Projects — needs validation
- S-05: Resume Existing Session — needs validation
- S-06: Fork — "Open Fork" implemented, needs screenshot validation
- S-07: MCP Server Management — CRUD UI exists, needs full validation
- S-08: Settings — cleanup done, partial screenshots exist, needs complete validation
- S-09: Plugin Management — real git clone done, needs E2E validation
- S-10: Skill Discovery & Install — UI exists, needs validation
- S-11: Projects — cleanup done, partial screenshots exist, needs complete validation
- S-12: Config Management — raw JSON editor exists, needs validation
- S-13: Cancel Stream — wired to backend, needs screenshot validation
