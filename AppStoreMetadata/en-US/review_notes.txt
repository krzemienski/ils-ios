ILS requires a companion backend server running on a Mac to function. The backend is included in the open-source repository and can be started with:

  PORT=9999 swift run ILSBackend

The app connects to this backend server over the local network. Without the backend running, the app will show a "Disconnected" state and prompt the user to configure a server connection.

To test:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/krzemienski/ils-ios
2. Run the backend: PORT=9999 swift run ILSBackend
3. Install the app on a simulator or device on the same network
4. The app should auto-discover the backend and show connected status

Key features to review:
- Dashboard with real-time statistics
- Chat interface with Claude (requires Claude Code CLI installed)
- Session, project, and skills browsing
- System monitoring
- Settings with theme customization

Note: Full chat functionality requires Claude Code CLI to be installed on the Mac running the backend. Without it, sessions and browsing features still work with existing data.
